# Research: Advancing A2UI Realtime UI Generation

## Current State
- A2UI protocol with NDJSON streaming
- 12 components: Text, Heading, Button, TextInput, Image, KeyValueList, Card, Alert, Badge, Table, Checkbox, Select, Progress
- FSM streaming: idle→preparing→streaming→complete
- Flex layout, Zod validation, bi-directional actions

## Research Areas
1. Advanced Components: charts, graphs, maps, calendars, code blocks, markdown, tabs, modals, carousels
2. Streaming/State: optimistic updates, partial streaming, error recovery, Suspense, offline support
3. AI-Assisted UI: component discovery, prop inference, layout suggestions, context awareness
4. A11y/i18n: ARIA live regions, translations, screen readers, reduced motion
5. Performance: virtualization, lazy loading, bundle impact, backpressure
6. Design System: tokens, theming, typography/spacing scales
7. DX: visual debugger, schema docs, component preview, stream replay
8. Security: sanitization, resource limits, CSP, rate limiting

## Questions
- What for A2UI v2? (versioning, plugins)
- OpenAI GPTs Actions UI patterns?
- Vercel AI SDK Generative UI approaches?
- When raw HTML vs declarative? (Google GenUI)
- AI-readable component descriptions? (Tambo)
- LangChain/LlamaIndex UI tool outputs?
- Multi-user A2UI collaboration?

## Deliverable
1. Executive Summary
2. Category Analysis
3. Priority (H/M/L)
4. Code Examples
5. Lib Recommendations
6. Competitive Analysis
7. A2UI Extensions Proposal
8. Research Links

Focus: actionable 3-6 month roadmap.
